#Silly Calculator

This is a simple project trying to implement John Napier's location arithmetic from his 1617 treatise [Rabdology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabdology).

It traditionally uses a checkerboard with binary positions to make calculations. Currently I've only implemented multiplication.

This is by no means supposed to be in any way efficient (I'm sure an O(n^2) multiplication function is very sought out) it's just a silly idea I wanted to try and put into code.

## Running the program

The program has a very simple text interface that you can run by running run.py which provides you with choices as to how many bits the checkerboard should be along with wath functions you want to carry out. 

I might add code to parse a string of mathematical operations at some point, but that's much later down the line so that I can focus on working through the actual operations.
